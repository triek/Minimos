Minimos is a 2D colony simulation game developed by Triek, focused on indirect control rather than direct character movement. Players assign tasks to settlers, who then move, wander, and perform actions automatically using a task queue system. The game emphasizes planning, management, and observing systems interact instead of micromanagement.

The game is built in Unity using C#, developed with Visual Studio, and version-controlled with GitHub. All graphics, including maps, characters, and UI elements, are handmade using Adobe Photoshop. Minimos is inspired by colony and life simulation games such as Going Medieval and Stardew Valley, and was created as a practical application of object-oriented programming and data structures and algorithms, including queues, lists, and A* pathfinding.

Minimos has strong potential for future expansion. Planned improvements include additional task types like farming, building, and crafting, smarter AI behavior, improved animations and visual feedback, role-based settlers, and a save/load system. Working with more people would also help speed up development and make the game more fun to build.
